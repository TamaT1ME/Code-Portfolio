    <h3>Meta Tags (Check Code File)</h3>

    <!-- You can add metadata to your web pages by placing <meta> tags inside the header of the document which is represented by <head> and </head> tags.
      A meta tag can have following attributes in addition to core attributes:
    name = name for a property, can be anything, keywords, description, author... etc. keywords are used by the search engines while indexing your webpage for searching purpose.
   content = specifies property's value.
   scheme = specifies a scheme to interpret the property's value (as declared in the content attribute).
   http-equiv = Used for http response message headers. For example, http-equiv can be used to refresh the page or to set a cookie. Values include content-type, expires, refresh and set-cookie. -->

    <!-- examples:
    KEYWORDS
      <meta name = "keywords" content = "HTML, Meta Tags, Metadata" />
   DESCRIPTION
      <meta name = "description" content = "Learning about Meta Tags." />
   REVISION
      <meta name = "revised" content = "Tutorialspoint, 3/7/2014" />
   REFRESHING
      <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "5" /> this would refresh your site every 5 seconds.
   REDIRECTION
      <meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "5; url = http://www.tutorialspoint.com" /> content would redirect after 5 seconds.
   COOKIES
      <meta http-equiv = "cookie" content = "userid = xyz; expires = Wednesday, 08-Aug-15 23:59:59 GMT;" /> If you do not include the expiration date and time, the cookie is considered a session cookie and will be deleted when the user exits the browser.
   AUTHOR NAME
      <meta name = "author" content = "Mahnaz Mohtashim" />

   VIEWPORT INFO & FORMAT
      The basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include:
         width=
         Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.
         
         height=
         Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like height=400 or to the special value device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.
         
         initial-scale=
         Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 1. Negative values: ignored.
         
         minimum-scale=
         Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.
         
         maximum-scale=
         Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 10. Negative values: ignored.
         
         user-scalable=
         Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, which is the same as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom.
         
         interactive-widget=
         Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's viewports. Valid values: resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default: resizes-visual.
